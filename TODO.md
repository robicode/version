# Work needed to be done on this module
I'm not an expert coder, and there are a few things still needed in this library:

* Sorting of both *Version and *Requirement lists
* Docs could probably be better
* More tests
* I'm sure the code could be refined

If you have suggestions or want to contribute code, feel free to open an issue or create a PR.
